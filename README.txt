	Task:
	Implement (in C++, MATLAB, or Java) a Fraction class that supports the following operations: 
	addition, subtraction,multiplication, division, equality/non-equality, greater than/less than, and display. 
	The project should take on the order of several hours. If you have some ideas that would take longer to implement please write them down for discussion.

	Solution:
	Language chosen : C++ 
	IDE :Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate
	Concept Used:Operator Overloading
	
	Summary
	The Fraction class has one data member an array of size 2 .
	The array stores the integer values of the numerator and denominator.
 	for a Fraction class object : fractionObject = numerator/denominator ;where denominator != 0
	
 
	The Fraction class provides the following services:

	 1.A default constructor that accepts no arguments
	 2.constructor accepting two integers
	 3.constructor accepting an array of two integers
	 4.Destructor 
	 5.simplify function to reduce the fraction
	 6.set functions
	 7. get functions
	 8.Add two fractions
	 9.Subtract two fractions
	 10.Multiply two fractions
	 11.Divide two fractions
	 12.Add      an integer to   a fraction
	 13.Subtract an integer from a fraction
	 14.Multiply an integer by   a fraction
	 15.Divide an integer   by   a fraction
	 16.Add      a fraction to   an integer
	 17.Subtract a fraction from a integer
	 18.Multiply a fraction by   a integer
	 19.Divide a fraction   by   a integer
	 20.Equality operator for two fractions ,an integer and a fraction and vice versa.
	 21.Greater than operator for two fractions ,an integer and a fraction and vice versa.
	 22.Less than operator two fractions ,an integer and a fraction and vice versa.
	 23. friend functions for input display
	
	
	The main function "test-drives" the objects  of the Fraction class by instantiating objects and
 	performing arithematic operations(addition,subraction,multiplication ,division ,comparision)
	 on them and displaying the final results.
